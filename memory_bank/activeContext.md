Current Focus:
- Ensuring score display matches selection/removal logic.
- Board selection logic and UI feedback for connected blocks.
Recent Changes:
- Score display hidden when no group is selected.
- Score incremented on group removal.
- Randomized block colors.
- Implemented group selection and deselection logic.
Open Questions:
- Should additional feedback or animation be added for score changes?
- Should selection logic be extended to support additional game mechanics (e.g., clearing selected blocks)?
