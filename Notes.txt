This is especially useful for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply your own template using lodash templates, or use your own loader.

There were a bunch of vulnerabilities noted when installing these... need to figure out what's up with that (since I didn't specify a version)

npm install --save-dev babel

npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties


Now there's an error in the build
Error: Cannot find package '@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread' imported from D:\Development\Code\blocks-game\babel-virtual-resolve-base.js
And that ^ deprecated
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
> This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-object-rest-spread instead.



        "@babel/core": "^7.28.5",
        "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties": "^7.18.6",
        "@babel/preset-env": "^7.28.5",
        "babel": "^5.8.38",
        "babel-loader": "^10.0.0",

So I ran into some issues getting things to work.. possibly because I copied stuff over from another project.
I'm going to try re-adding dependencies from scratch

Starting by following the info on this package
https://medium.com/@robinviktorsson/setting-up-a-modern-typescript-project-with-webpack-no-framework-541cc007c46f

Removed the node_modules directory
Removed dependencies from package.json

> npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin ts-node typescript ts-loader style-loader css-loader
added 377 packages, and audited 378 packages in 12s
79 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

So that's good


And then adding in the extract plugin (not sure I need it)

So, I updated VS Code and now it can't open a CoPilot chat window, because

2025-12-09 16:10:52.964 [error] [Window] ChatSessionStore: Error reading chat session file a667901d-f0f5-479e-b877-dee7762e885e Unable to read file 'c:\Users\RHSeeger\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\workspaceStorage\df987925b1e24ba2a7d112395516357f\chatSessions\a667901d-f0f5-479e-b877-dee7762e885e.json' (Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file 'c:\Users\RHSeeger\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\workspaceStorage\df987925b1e24ba2a7d112395516357f\chatSessions\a667901d-f0f5-479e-b877-dee7762e885e.json')
2025-12-09 16:10:52.965 [error] [Window] Error: Failed to get model for chat editor. resource: vscode-chat-session://local/YTY2NzkwMWQtZjBmNS00NzllLWI4NzctZGVlNzc2MmU4ODVl

which... makes sense because that file doesn't exist. But why is it looking for it?

I had to close the chat window and then restart CS Code... and the error went away

The memory bank stuff stopped working, and I have no idea what
I can't, for the life of me, figure out how to get AGENTS.md to read the memory-bank.md file...
It _should_ be reading it, because there's a command that tells it to

There's also a command that tells it to add "Processed: AGENTS.md" to the chat output when done reading it and following it's instructions...
And that worked once... and then never again
