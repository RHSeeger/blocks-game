There were a bunch of vulnerabilities noted when installing these... need to figure out what's up with that (since I didn't specify a version)

npm install --save-dev babel

npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties


Now there's an error in the build
Error: Cannot find package '@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread' imported from D:\Development\Code\blocks-game\babel-virtual-resolve-base.js
And that ^ deprecated
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
> This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-object-rest-spread instead.



        "@babel/core": "^7.28.5",
        "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties": "^7.18.6",

So I ran into some issues getting things to work.. possibly because I copied stuff over from another project.
I'm going to try re-adding dependencies from scratch

Starting by following the info on this package
https://medium.com/@robinviktorsson/setting-up-a-modern-typescript-project-with-webpack-no-framework-541cc007c46f

Removed the node_modules directory
Removed dependencies from package.json

So that's good


And then adding in the extract plugin (not sure I need it)

So, I updated VS Code and now it can't open a CoPilot chat window, because

2025-12-09 16:10:52.964 [error] [Window] ChatSessionStore: Error reading chat session file a667901d-f0f5-479e-b877-dee7762e885e Unable to read file 'c:\Users\RHSeeger\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\workspaceStorage\df987925b1e24ba2a7d112395516357f\chatSessions\a667901d-f0f5-479e-b877-dee7762e885e.json' (Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file 'c:\Users\RHSeeger\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\workspaceStorage\df987925b1e24ba2a7d112395516357f\chatSessions\a667901d-f0f5-479e-b877-dee7762e885e.json')

which... makes sense because that file doesn't exist. But why is it looking for it?

I had to close the chat window and then restart CS Code... and the error went away

The memory bank stuff stopped working, and I have no idea what
I can't, for the life of me, figure out how to get AGENTS.md to read the memory-bank.md file...
It _should_ be reading it, because there's a command that tells it to

There's also a command that tells it to add "Processed: AGENTS.md" to the chat output when done reading it and following it's instructions...
And that worked once... and then never again


Something about the computer player (score, stats, maybe computer player achievments?) will provide points used to enhance player play

Something about player play (score, maybe achievments?) will unlock or provide enhancements for computer player play

Achievements can unlock new functionality, like the +1 block

Maybe achievements can unlock things
And purchaseble things (based on pts, # of achievements, etc) allow buying enhancements for things
    including both normal things (like number of points per block) and unlocked things (like allowing for more than 1 special block)

Getting a group of 2 blocks is an achievement, and unlocks the +1 cube for the player
Gettign a group of 2 blocks plus a +1 block is an achiement, and unlucks the +1 cube for the computer

---------------

So, the AI is completely incapable of writing code that passes around the data it needs. In order to pass around the 
data it needs, the system as a whole needs to be designed to allow for it. And the code it writes doesn't really pay 
attention to larger goals. This is especially true when something needed "farther along" isn't needed in the specific
function. For example, the function modifies the cubes for the player's board, but then needs to save the game state. 
Saving the game state requires the _entire_ game state (or the ability to save just a piece of the state, leaving the
rest alone). So the function needs not just the board, but also the entire game state. And... the AI just blows the
entire code base up.

It might be possible to prevent that, but I spend more time fighting with the AI than it would take to just do it
myself. And I'm _really_ trying to get the AI to write as much of the code as possible (that's kind of the point of
this experiment)

So asking it to refactor some code so that it takes what it needs as inputs... results in
it just flat out breaking everything; over an over.


So I'm going to approach things from another angle. 
- Store the "game state" in a single object and reference that object from `window.gameState`
- The value in `window.gameState` is the source of truth. Anything that modifies the game state must read it from there, 
  make it's changes, and write back to there
- The ui code (in `/ui/`) is **only** for rendering the game display
  - The ui code doesn't know anything about behavior... it just reads the current `window.gameState` and updates the display
  - The ui knows that things happen based on interactions (clicks), but doesn't implement that logic. It handles accepting
    the click and then sends it off to the game-logic code to act on (which will then call back to the ui code if the game state
    changed)
  - The game-logic code doesn't know anything about the ui, other than that it can call the ui code to render the game state (and
    possible specific portions of the game state). In theory, the ui code could be completely replaced and the game-logic code
    wouldn't have to change at all. 
  - The game-logic code reads the `window.gameState`, makes changes, and writes back to `window.gameState`; then tells the ui to
    render the current state.
  - No stored values outside of `window.gameState` are ever needed to implement game logic; everything else is code/logic/constants.
  - No stored values outside of `window.gameState` are ever needed to render the ui; everything else is code/logic/constants.

Some ideas for other special blocks
- x2 blocks - multiplies the score for the block group by 2 (had this for a version of the game written long ago, in Tcl/Tk)
  - can buy block type up to x3, x4, etc using powerup points (or whatever they wind up getting called)
- R, L, U, D ; "direction" specials - for the given "base" blocks in the group, adds all blocks to the direction (ex, right) to the group
- square block - for a given base blocks in the group, adds all the blocks required to make the selection a square

Need to figure out if there's an "order" for specials
Or if they all act on the initial block group
If they all act on the initial block group, then +1 doesn't add much over square block, etc
And x# seems like it should act on the final block group
Could have all + types (+1, R, square, etc) all act on the initial group, but it does leave the issue of +1 and squre being kind of a 
    poor combo (since the +1 will probably add only +1 to +4 blocks once the square is added in, etc)
