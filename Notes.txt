> The HtmlWebpackPlugin simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. This is especially useful for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply your own template using lodash templates, or use your own loader.

There were a bunch of vulnerabilities noted when installing these... need to figure out what's up with that (since I didn't specify a version)

npm install --save-dev babel

npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties


Now there's an error in the build
Error: Cannot find package '@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread' imported from D:\Development\Code\blocks-game\babel-virtual-resolve-base.js
And that ^ deprecated
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
> This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-object-rest-spread instead.



        "@babel/core": "^7.28.5",
        "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties": "^7.18.6",
        "@babel/preset-env": "^7.28.5",
        "babel": "^5.8.38",
        "babel-loader": "^10.0.0",

So I ran into some issues getting things to work.. possibly because I copied stuff over from another project.
I'm going to try re-adding dependencies from scratch

Starting by following the info on this package
https://medium.com/@robinviktorsson/setting-up-a-modern-typescript-project-with-webpack-no-framework-541cc007c46f

Removed the node_modules directory
Removed dependencies from package.json

> npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin ts-node typescript ts-loader style-loader css-loader
added 377 packages, and audited 378 packages in 12s
79 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details
found 0 vulnerabilities

So that's good


And then adding in the extract plugin (not sure I need it)

PS D:\Development\Code\blocks-game> npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin
added 1 package, and audited 379 packages in 1s
